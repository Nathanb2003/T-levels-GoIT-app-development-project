# T-levels-GoIT-app-development-project
In this project we were approached by GoIT to create an app which could help in the education or health sector. I chose the health sector as due to COVID, people have cared less and less about their health, and I hoped that I could change things with this app. My app was an exercise app which has incentives and is specialised for each age and weight range. With my app I was planning to work with nutritional experts to create a diet plan for people of all sorts of ages, weight, dietary needs and even financial status. This app did have ads to generate a revenue which we could use to pay our mentors, experts and the rest we would re-exert into our app into a monthly based subscription where if the customer is subscribed, they can earn rewards based off of their effort and how much exercise they have done.
